## Introduction

With æScan you can easily navigate between different features and live statistics of æternity blockchain: keyblocks,
microblocks, accounts, transactions, smart contracts, names and tokens.

Blockchain data is retrieved from [æternity middleware](https://github.com/aeternity/ae_mdw)
and [æternity node](https://github.com/aeternity/aeternity).

Nuxt 3, Vue.js, Vite and Pinia provide the foundation for the project, enabling us to create a seamless and intuitive
user experience with Server Side Rendering enabled.

## Getting started

First, download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Version 20
or higher is required.

Clone æScan repository

```
git clone https://github.com/aeternity/aescan.git
```

Install required dependencies with yarn

```
yarn install
```

Copy content of `.env.example` file to `.env`

Run æScan in development mode with hot reload

```
yarn dev
```

A local instance of æScan will be available at http://localhost:8080.

### Other commands
